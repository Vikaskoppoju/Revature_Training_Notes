### **Referential Integrity, Multiplicity, and Cascading **

In relational database design, **referential integrity** ensures that relationships between tables are valid and consistent. **Multiplicity** refers to the cardinality of relationships (how many entities from one table relate to entities in another table), and **cascading** defines the rules for handling changes in one table that affect related rows in another table. Together, they help maintain data consistency and accuracy in a database system.

### **1. Referential Integrity**

**Referential Integrity** ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. It is enforced through the use of **foreign keys**. A **foreign key** in one table points to a **primary key** in another table, and it ensures that the value in the foreign key column(s) always exists in the referenced table.

#### **Foreign Key Constraints:**
- A foreign key in a child table must match a primary key or unique key in the parent table, ensuring valid relationships.
- It prevents **orphan records** â€” records in the child table that do not correspond to any record in the parent table.

#### **Creating a Foreign Key:**
A foreign key is created when you define a relationship between two tables.

#### **Example:**

```sql
-- Create a parent table `Departments`
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create a child table `Employees` with a foreign key referencing `Departments`
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(department_id)
);
```

- In this example:
  - The `Departments` table is the parent table with the primary key `department_id`.
  - The `Employees` table is the child table, and the `department_id` column in the child table references the `department_id` column in the parent table.
  - The foreign key ensures that each employee is assigned to a valid department.

### **2. Multiplicity (Cardinality of Relationships)**

**Multiplicity** refers to the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity. There are three primary types of relationships in terms of multiplicity:

1. **One-to-One (1:1):**
   - Each row in Table A is related to one and only one row in Table B.
   
2. **One-to-Many (1:N) or Many-to-One (N:1):**
   - One row in Table A can be related to many rows in Table B, but each row in Table B can only be related to one row in Table A.
   
3. **Many-to-Many (M:N):**
   - Many rows in Table A can be related to many rows in Table B. This relationship is usually represented by a third table (called a junction table or associative table).

#### **Examples:**

- **One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Passports (
    passport_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    person_id INT UNIQUE,
    issue_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES Persons(person_id)
);
```
- Each `Person` can have one `Passport`, and each `Passport` belongs to exactly one `Person`.

- **One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```
- Each `Customer` can have many `Orders`, but each `Order` belongs to one `Customer`.

- **Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Junction Table to represent Many-to-Many Relationship
CREATE TABLE Student_Courses (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Courses(course_id)
);
```
- A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and a `Course` can have many `Students`.

### **3. Cascading (Cascading Actions)**

**Cascading** defines the rules that determine what happens to rows in the child table when changes are made to the referenced rows in the parent table. Cascading can be used when performing actions like `DELETE` or `UPDATE`.

#### **Cascading Options:**
1. **CASCADE**: Automatically updates or deletes the corresponding rows in the child table when a row in the parent table is updated or deleted.
2. **SET NULL**: Sets the foreign key column in the child table to `NULL` when a row in the parent table is updated or deleted.
3. **NO ACTION**: No action is taken when a row in the parent table is updated or deleted (the default).
4. **RESTRICT**: Prevents the action on the parent table if there are any matching rows in the child table.
5. **SET DEFAULT**: Sets the foreign key column in the child table to its default value when the row in the parent table is updated or deleted (less common in MySQL).

#### **Example of Cascading:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

- **ON DELETE CASCADE**: If a `Customer` is deleted, all related orders will also be automatically deleted.
- **ON UPDATE CASCADE**: If a `Customer`'s `customer_id` is updated, the `customer_id` in all related `Orders` will be automatically updated to match the new value.

#### **Example of SET NULL:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
    ON UPDATE SET NULL
);
```
- **ON DELETE SET NULL**: If a `Customer` is deleted, the `customer_id` in all related orders will be set to `NULL`.
- **ON UPDATE SET NULL**: If a `Customer`'s `customer_id` is updated, the `customer_id` in all related `Orders` will be set to `NULL`.

#### **Example of RESTRICT:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT
    ON UPDATE RESTRICT
);
```
- **ON DELETE RESTRICT**: Prevents the deletion of a `Customer` if there are any related `Orders`.
- **ON UPDATE RESTRICT**: Prevents the update of a `Customer`'s `customer_id` if there are any related `Orders`.

---

### **Cascading Scenarios:**

#### **Scenario 1: Cascade Delete**
- You have an `Orders` table with a foreign key reference to `Customers`.
- When a `Customer` is deleted, all their `Orders` should also be deleted automatically.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### **Scenario 2: Cascade Update**
- If a `Customer`'s ID is changed, the `customer_id` in all related `Orders` should be updated automatically.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

#### **Scenario 3: Set NULL on Delete**
- If a `Customer` is deleted, the `customer_id` in all related `Orders` should be set to `NULL`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

#### **Scenario 4: Prevent Delete**
- If a `Customer` has related `Orders`, you can't delete that `Customer`. This is enforced by `RESTRICT`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT
);
```

### **Conclusion**

- **Referential Integrity** ensures relationships between tables remain valid through **foreign keys**.
- **Multiplicity** refers to the type of relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N) between entities.
- **Cascading** actions define how updates and deletes in a parent table affect related records in the child table.

By understanding and applying these concepts, you can design robust databases that maintain data consistency and integrity, even when data in related tables changes.
