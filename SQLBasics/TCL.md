### **Transaction Control Language (TCL) **

Transaction Control Language (TCL) is a set of SQL commands used to manage transactions in a relational database. It ensures the integrity of data when multiple operations are performed as a unit. In MySQL, TCL allows us to control how changes to the database are made and whether those changes are committed or rolled back. The key TCL commands in MySQL are:

1. **COMMIT**
2. **ROLLBACK**
3. **SAVEPOINT**
4. **SET TRANSACTION**

---

### **1. COMMIT**
The `COMMIT` command is used to save all the changes made during the current transaction. Once a `COMMIT` is issued, all changes are permanently written to the database.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
COMMIT;
```

#### **Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

- In this example:
  - A transaction is started using `START TRANSACTION`.
  - Two updates are made to the `Accounts` table.
  - After the updates, `COMMIT` is used to save those changes to the database.

---

### **2. ROLLBACK**
The `ROLLBACK` command is used to undo any changes made during the current transaction. It reverts the database back to the state before the transaction began. This is useful when an error occurs and you want to discard all changes made within a transaction.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

#### **Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Suppose we encounter an error here and decide to roll back
ROLLBACK;
```

- In this example, the changes made to the `Accounts` table are rolled back, and the database remains unchanged.

---

### **3. SAVEPOINT**
A `SAVEPOINT` is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. It allows partial rollbacks, meaning you can undo part of the changes made in a transaction without rolling back the entire transaction.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
```

#### **Example:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT save1;  -- Set a savepoint here

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Suppose the second update fails, we can roll back to savepoint
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT save1;

COMMIT;
```

- In this example:
  - A transaction is started.
  - The first `UPDATE` is done, followed by creating a `SAVEPOINT` called `save1`.
  - A second `UPDATE` is performed, but if it fails, we can `ROLLBACK` to the `save1` point, discarding only the second update.

---

### **4. SET TRANSACTION**
The `SET TRANSACTION` command is used to define the properties of the transaction, such as setting the isolation level.

#### **Syntax:**
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL {level};
```

#### **Isolation Levels:**
1. **READ UNCOMMITTED**
2. **READ COMMITTED**
3. **REPEATABLE READ**
4. **SERIALIZABLE**

#### **Example:**

```sql
-- Set the transaction isolation level to REPEATABLE READ
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```

- In this example, the `SET TRANSACTION` command sets the transaction isolation level to `REPEATABLE READ`, ensuring that if a transaction reads data, that data will not change until the transaction completes.

---

### **How TCL Works in MySQL**

1. **Start Transaction:**
   - In MySQL, a transaction is automatically started with the first SQL statement. You can also explicitly start a transaction with `START TRANSACTION` or `BEGIN` statement.

2. **Transaction Boundaries:**
   - A transaction starts with `START TRANSACTION` and ends with either a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

3. **Commit:**
   - After all operations in the transaction are successful and you want to make the changes permanent, you use `COMMIT`.

4. **Rollback:**
   - If there is an error during the transaction and you want to revert to the state before the transaction, use `ROLLBACK`.

5. **Savepoint:**
   - You can use `SAVEPOINT` to mark specific points in the transaction. You can roll back to these points without affecting the entire transaction.

---

### **Real-World Example: Bank Transfer**

Imagine you have two accounts, and you want to transfer money from one account to another. This operation involves multiple steps (debiting one account and crediting another), and if any step fails, you need to roll back the transaction.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Debit Account 1
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Credit Account 2
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- If all operations are successful, commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

If an error occurs after debiting Account 1 but before crediting Account 2, you can roll back the transaction:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Simulate an error (e.g., insufficient funds in Account 2)
ROLLBACK;
```

---

### **Advantages of TCL:**

1. **Atomicity:**  
   - Ensures that either all operations in a transaction are committed or none are (rollback).

2. **Consistency:**  
   - Guarantees that the database remains in a valid state after each transaction.

3. **Isolation:**  
   - Allows controlling the level of visibility of transactions to others, preventing dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, etc.

4. **Durability:**  
   - Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in case of a system failure.

---

### **Conclusion**

TCL in MySQL plays an important role in ensuring **data integrity** and **consistency**. By using `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, and `SET TRANSACTION`, you can control how data is manipulated in the database and ensure that changes are either applied completely or reverted in case of an error. Understanding TCL is crucial for handling complex multi-step operations, ensuring reliability, and preventing inconsistent states in your database.
